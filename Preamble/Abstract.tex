	Internet of Vehicles and Intelligent Transportation has become promising due to the emergence of embedded and connected smart devices, systems, and technologies. The rapid growth of Internet of Vehicles has brought huge challenges for large data storage, intelligent management, and information security for the entire system. Therefore, in the upcoming era of the Internet of Things, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will play a crucial role in newly developed smart cities. This work proposes a security system for data sharing between vehicles, which is securing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, and between vehicles and other system nodes, which is securing Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. The proposed solution is a decentralized system based on blockchain, cryptography, and fog computing. We evaluate our work using a formal security analysis tool against common network attacks, and network researching simulation tools for deploying a visualized proof of concept for our design. \\ \\
